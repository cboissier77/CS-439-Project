# CS-439-Project
CS-439 (Optimization for machine learning) Group project

##  Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebooks Overview
* shapes.ipynb: Runs the models, calculates accuracy, loss, and computation time for two models. The results are saved in the ```pickle_lists/``` folder.
* plot_shapes.ipynb: Used to generate figures for the report, including accuracy and computation time visualizations.
* confusion_matrix.ipynb: Displays the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
* another_curr.ipynb: Contains the reordered dataset used with Model 2 at the end of the report.

## Utilities 
Utility functions and scripts to support dataset handling, model evaluation, and plotting are located in the ```utilities/``` directory.

## Datasets 
All used datasets, including training and testing sets, can be found in the ```dataset/``` folder.
