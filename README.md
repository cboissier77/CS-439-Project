##  Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Notebooks Overview
shapes.ipynb: This notebook was used to run the models, to calculate their accuracies, their losses, their time of computation for the two models. The lists were then saved in ```pickle_lists```folder.
plot_shapes.ipynb: Generates and visualizes geometric shapes from the dataset.
confusion_matrix.ipynb: Evaluates model predictions and displays the confusion matrix.
another_curr.ipynb: May contain model training or variant experimentation.
